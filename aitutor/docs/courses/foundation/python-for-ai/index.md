Welcome to **Python for AI** - a hands-on, beginner-friendly course designed specifically for aspiring AI/ML engineers. This course focuses exclusively on Python concepts that are **must-haves** for AI work, cutting out general programming topics that aren't immediately relevant to building AI systems.

## Why This Course is Different

Most Python courses teach web development, automation, and general programming concepts. This course is laser-focused on getting you ready to build AI models in PyTorch and TensorFlow as quickly as possible.

**You'll Learn:**

- ✅ Python syntax used in 90% of AI tutorials
- ✅ Data manipulation with NumPy (the foundation of tensors)
- ✅ How to read and debug AI code
- ✅ Working with datasets and batches
- ✅ Building a complete ML pipeline from scratch

## Target Audience

**Perfect for:**

- Complete beginners with zero programming experience
- Developers from other languages (Java, C++, JavaScript) transitioning to AI
- Anyone who wants to understand PyTorch/TensorFlow tutorials without getting stuck on Python syntax

**NOT for:**

- General Python learners (try a different course)
- Web developers looking for Django/Flask
- Automation/scripting specialists

## Course Structure

**Duration:** 2 weeks (10-12 hours total)

**Format:** Each lesson includes:

- 📖 15-20 min concept explanation with visuals
- 💻 30-40 min interactive Google Colab notebook (FREE GPU access)
- 📹 Reference YouTube video (max 10 min) for additional context
- ✅ 5-7 question quiz
- 🎯 Mini-exercise applying concepts to AI problems

### Lesson Roadmap

| Lesson | Topic | Duration | AI Focus |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | [Python Basics](01-basics.md) | 1 hour | Variables, operators, string formatting for logging |
| 2 | [Lists and Indexing](02-lists.md) | 1 hour | Training data, batches, slicing |
| 3 | [Dictionaries](03-dictionaries.md) | 1 hour | Model configs, hyperparameters, metrics |
| 4 | [Loops and Iteration](04-loops.md) | 1.5 hours | Epoch loops, batch processing, early stopping |
| 5 | [NumPy Essentials](05-numpy.md) | 2 hours | Tensors, array operations, broadcasting |
| 6 | [Functions and Modules](06-functions.md) | 1.5 hours | Custom loss functions, importing PyTorch |
| 7 | [Mini-Project: MNIST](07-mini-project.md) | 2.5 hours | Complete ML pipeline end-to-end |

## Prerequisites

**Required:**

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Google account (for Colab access)
- Enthusiasm to learn AI

**NOT Required:**

- Programming experience
- Math beyond high school level
- Expensive GPUs or software

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. **Read AI Code** - Understand 90% of PyTorch/TensorFlow tutorials without confusion
2. **Manipulate Data** - Load, clean, and transform datasets like a pro
3. **Debug Scripts** - Fix common errors in Jupyter notebooks confidently
4. **Use AI Libraries** - Import packages, call functions, understand documentation
5. **Run Experiments** - Modify hyperparameters, compare results, track metrics

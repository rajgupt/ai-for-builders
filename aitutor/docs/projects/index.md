# Portfolio Projects

Build real-world AI projects that you can showcase in your portfolio, GitHub, and resume.

## Why Projects Matter

- **Learn by Doing:** Hands-on experience beats passive learning
- **Portfolio Building:** Demonstrate your skills to employers
- **GitHub Contributions:** Show your work in public repositories
- **Real-world Impact:** Solve actual problems with AI
